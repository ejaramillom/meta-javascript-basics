// the DOM is an object written in javascript language who lives in the browser memory. It is called the "document" object and represents each node of the html file received from the server and read by the browser, which in turn converts the document in visible objects in the screen.

// to manipulate the dom, we can go to the console and write the following 

/* 

const h2 = document.createElement('h2')
h2.innerText = "This is a heading"
h2.setAttribute('id', 'heading')
h2.setAttribute('class', 'secondary')
h2
document.body.appendChild(h2)
