// class 08: data types and use cases

var person = null
// means there is no value (absence of value)

var car = undefined
// means car does not have an assigned value

console.log("car value", car,"person value", person)

// ES6 included 2 new data types, BigInt which helps to work with bigger numbers than number type can handle, and symbol type, for unique identifiers

console.log(typeof person)

// here we check what type is person variable
