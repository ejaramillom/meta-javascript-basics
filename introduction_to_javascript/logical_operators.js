/* You are coding an RPG game, where each character has certain skill levels based on the value saved in their score.

Create a variable named score and set it to 8

Use console.log() that includes the string "Mid-level skills:" and compares the score variable to above 0 and below 10 using the && operator

The expected output in the console should be: "Mid-level skills: true" . */

/* Task 6: Use the += operator to accumulate values in a variable

Code a new variable and name it counter , assigning it to the value of 0 .

On the next line, use the += operator to increase the value of counter by 5 .

On the next line, use the += operator to increase the value of counter by 3 .

On the fourth line, console log the value of the counter variable.

Note : The output value should be 8 . */
